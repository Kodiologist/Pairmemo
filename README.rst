Pairmemo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pairmemo is an R package for flexible on-disk function memoization. It allows you to cache function calls based on their arguments. Compared to ``memoise`` and ``targets``, Pairmemo emphasizes manual cache management. Caching is keyed by the function's name and arguments but not by its body, so you can choose which cache entries to delete (if any) when altering the function. You can even add new parameters without invalidating the cache, if you give them default arguments. These features make Pairmemo appropriate for large projects where having to rerun code unnecessarily could take days, while Pairmemo's interface remains convenient for small tasks. Pairmemo also stores its calls on disk in a simple fashion that makes them easy to work with outside of Pairmemo, or outside of R entirely.

Usage
============================================================

Install the package with ``remotes::install_github``. Run the tests with ``testthat::test_dir("tests")`` or ``devtools::check()``. `Read the documentation online <https://arfer.net/code/pairmemo>`__, or in R with ``?`` or ``help``.
